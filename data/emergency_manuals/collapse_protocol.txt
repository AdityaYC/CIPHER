Building collapse search and rescue procedures.

Before entry: Structural assessment by qualified person. Identify load-bearing walls and collapse zones. Check for secondary collapse risk, gas, electrical hazards. Establish communication protocol (hand signals, radio) and backup. Never enter alone; buddy system required.

Victim location: Use systematic search (grid or quadrant). Listen for tapping, voice, use acoustic sensors if available. Mark searched areas. Document locations for rescue teams. Use canines if available for live scent.

Structural assessment: Crack classification — hairline (monitor), moderate (restrict access), severe (evacuate). Assess foundation movement, leaning walls, hanging loads. When in doubt, do not enter. Communicate findings to incident command.
